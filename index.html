        <h1>Your Eyes</h1>
        <h3>Your eyes have a peculiar sweetness, once I gaze into them, my heart never wants to look away.But unfortunately, I have to look away. Until today, I've never had the courage to look directly into your eyes. I don't know how true it is that I can read your eyes, but believe me, whenever I look into your eyes, I can tell whether you're angry, upset, or happy. Your eyes are so enchanting, and I regret that I can't see them forever</h3>

        <h3>There's a magic in your smile that calms my heart in an instant.I haven't had the fortune to see your smile up close yet, but when I sense that you're happy, it's a feeling beyond words. I can't express how much peace it brings to my heart. Though I haven't had the chance to see it directly, I’ve witnessed your smile, and ever since, I’ve vowed that I would do anything—even give my life—for the smile on your face</h3>

        <h3>If I were to say which girl has the most beautiful character among all the girls I have seen, I would undoubtedly say your name. I've been watching you, secretly from the very beginning. You value others' feelings, and I've seen how you, despite your own struggles, always stay happy in front of others. A girl who values others' feelings more than her own is certainly not like every other girl. I see in you honesty, courage, self-respect, and the care you show for others. I can say with my eyes closed that finding a girl like you is only possible for someone truly fortunate.</h3>

        <h1>Saree On You</h1>
        <h3>In a saree, you look like a completely different kind of beauty. I’ve rarely had the fortune to see you in a saree, but every time I have, I’ve fallen more in love with you. There’s something I’m realizing today—whoever said that a woman’s beauty truly shines in a saree, they must have been praising someone they loved. Of all the regrets I have in life, the biggest one is not having the chance to see you in a saree, up close.</h3>

There's no need to go too far; let me just talk about myself—someone like me, a boy, who you have valued this much, is already a lot. I irritate you so much, I make you angry, but still, you forgive me every time. Until the end of my life, in my eyes, you will always be the best</h3>

Even in this age, there are people like you with such a good heart. I often observe your behavior, your beauty, your love and respect for others.

If I had the chance, I would love you so much that words couldn’t explain it. I would give my all just to make sure no tear ever falls from your eyes.</h3>

      <h1>Your First Birthday In sylhet</h1>
      <h3>I still remember your first birthday. I didn’t know it was your birthday, but I would often go to your Facebook and look at your pictures. One day, I suddenly noticed that your birthday was on the 15th. You know me, I don't even know how I spend my money. So, I went to Zindabazar. I didn’t like any watch, but I ended up picking a simple one. I was thinking that I might get to see you, but you were wearing a mask. That day, I was thinking to myself, 'Next birthday, I’ll give you something better, InshaAllah</h3>

I ended up ordering a few items, not realizing I could have gotten a better saree for the same price. When the parcel arrived, I didn’t open it right away, and the handwritten note I requested wasn’t included. Once again, things didn’t go as planned, but I promised myself that for the next birthday, I’ll do something even better, InshaAllah</h3>

My wish was that tonight at 12 o’clock, you would wear a dress I gave you, with flowers in your hair or on your wrist, and a birthday cake. But look at my luck, I lost track of time while trying to get the size right. However, yes, next time, I’ll do something even better than this, InshaAllah</h3>
